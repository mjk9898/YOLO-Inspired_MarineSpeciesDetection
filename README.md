# Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository pertaining to our journal: _Automated Detection and Classification of Marine Species Vocalizations Using A YOLO-Based Deep Learning Framework_.

**IN PROGRESS**

# Files
The repository contains the following files:
* 
* 
* 

Our research utilized the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for easier analysis and visualization. Please install Jupyter Notebook or use Google Colab, a free online Jupyter Notebook, to open the ipynb files. 

If you want to use other coding environments (IDE etc.), copy and paste the codes and files to your preferred coding environment.

# Python Libraries
Our research utilizes various Python libraries that need to be installed:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-Learn
* Pytorch

Refer to the Jupyter Notebook for the exact modules used.
If you use Google Colab, Google Colab already has built-in various Python modules, so no installation is necessary.
